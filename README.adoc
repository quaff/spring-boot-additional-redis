= Additional Redis for Spring Boot 3.4+

This project demonstrate how to configure additional redis services without backing off Spring Boot auto-configured one.
Thanks to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/2ecb4ebd4947cfe3abd28d9a611186b680a59959.

== Getting started

Add your own redis configuration class to extend `RedisConfigurationSupport` which is a bridge to Spring Boot's `RedisAutoConfigration`.
For example:
[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/example/FooRedisConfiguration.java[]
----

Then you can configure it as following:
[source,yaml]
----
# primary redis service
spring.data.redis:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 6379
  database: 0
  client-name: default

# additional foo redis service, inherit from primary properties
foo.data.redis:
  host: 127.0.0.1 # not required because it's equal to spring.data.redis.host
  database: 1
  client-name: foo
----

NOTE: Find and replace `foo` with your own prefix.
